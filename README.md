# about me

Hi I'm Julian, currently studying computer science at the Technical University of Munich, as well as working as a software engineer for TruPhysics, a robotics company from Stuttgart.

You can find most of my private projects here on my github. I also write blog posts about the cooler (and more recent projects) here: [blog.julianlimburg.zip](https://blog.julianlimburg.zip)
